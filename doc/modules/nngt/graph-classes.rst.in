Graph classes
=============

NNGT provides four main graph classes that provide specific features to work
as conveniently as possible with different object types: topological versus
space-embedded graphs or neuronal networks.

.. autosummary::

    nngt.Graph
    nngt.SpatialGraph
    nngt.Network
    nngt.SpatialNetwork


A summary of the methods provided by these classes as well as more detailed
descriptions are provided below.
Unless specified, child classes can use all methods from the parent class
(the only exception is :meth:`~nngt.Graph.set_types` which is not available
to the :class:`~nngt.Network` subclasses).

Summary of the class members and methods
----------------------------------------

Graph
+++++

The main class for topological graphs.

.. autosummary::

    nngt.Graph

@autosum@


SpatialGraph
++++++++++++

Subclass of :class:`~nngt.Graph` providing additional tools to work with
spatial graphs. It works together with the :class:`~nngt.geometry.Shape` object
from the :mod:`~nngt.geometry` module.

.. autosummary::

    nngt.SpatialGraph
@autosum@


Network
+++++++

Subclass of :class:`~nngt.Graph` providing additional tools to work with
neuronal networks. It works together with the
:class:`~nngt.NeuralPop` object.

.. autosummary::

    nngt.Network
@autosum@


SpatialNetwork
++++++++++++++

Subclass of :class:`~nngt.Graph` providing additional tools to work with
spatial neuronal networks. It works together with both
:class:`~nngt.NeuralPop` and the
:class:`~nngt.geometry.Shape` object from the :mod:`~nngt.geometry` module.
